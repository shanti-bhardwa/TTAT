sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Copy the following line and paste it at the end of the file.

deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main

 wget https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub

sudo apt-key add linux_signing_key.pub

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable
