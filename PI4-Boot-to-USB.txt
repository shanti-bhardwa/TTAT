IIAB 7.0 Build using latest Rasbian Images.

The IIAB 7.0 Image is built using the Raspbian Lite Image. You can burn this image to 16 GB SD card, boot up and build IIAB using the one-line install command


curl d.iiab.io/7.0/install.txt | sudo bash


See the changes I have made to the local_vars.yml. My comment start with #snb changes

OR you can use the 8GB images which has iiab7.0 already built as above.

You can burn this image to another 16GB SD card and it will boot FROM this card.

You can also use SSD in an external USB/SATA drive.

First you have to prepare another SD card with just the boot partions on it. Can use 2 GB card.

First format the card using FAT32 and name its volume name as boot

Copy ALL files from /boot partition to 2GB  SD card.

The cmdline.txt file has the change  for root=PARTUUID=6c586e13-02

from the original 

console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=6c586e13-02 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait

to root=/dev/sda2 

console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/sda2  rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait


to say to the PI 4 that root is on /dev/sda2 which is the external drive with the second partition. All the system files are on this root partition.

there is backup of cmdline.txt in the boot directory, just in case!!

Every time you prepare an image for booting from hard drive, create a separate boot card and change the cmdline.txt file as above.

This works on PI2B and all other PI models
